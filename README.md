# Monty - Lesson 0x19: C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## Lesson Overview
In Lesson 0x19, you will delve into the fascinating world of stacks and queues, exploring the concepts of LIFO (Last In, First Out) and FIFO (First In, First Out). You will learn about their essential characteristics, common use cases, and practical implementations. Additionally, you will understand when to use stacks and queues effectively.

## General Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should have a clear understanding of the following concepts:

1. **LIFO and FIFO**: You will grasp the meaning of LIFO (Last In, First Out) and FIFO (First In, First Out) and their relevance in programming.

2. **Stacks**: You will learn what a stack is, when to use it, and the common implementations of stacks.

3. **Queues**: You will understand the concept of a queue, its appropriate use cases, and the various implementations available.

4. **Common Use Cases**: You will explore real-world scenarios where stacks and queues are commonly used.

5. **Global Variables**: You will discover the best practices for using global variables in your programs.

## About Monty
Monty 0.98 is a dynamic scripting language that closely resembles Python in terms of its compilation process into Monty byte codes. These byte codes are instructions that are executed by a Monty interpreter. The core feature of Monty is its unique stack, which is manipulated through specific instructions.

### Project Goals
The primary objective of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files. In essence, you will be building a program that can read and execute Monty scripts, which involve pushing and popping data onto and off the stack, among other operations.
